**Live Link** [play here] 

## Objective

Matching Cards is a memory game, or game of concentration in where all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. Cards are faced down in a random pattern, and players must be able to find the matching pairs. 
- flip over one card at a time, and only 2 cards can be turned over at any given time. 
- if card pair is not a match, players must flip both cards, facing down, and try to find a matching pair again. 

## Solution 
Matching Cards can be a timed game, and cards all card pairs must be found by the expiration of the clock. The less correct moves, will result in a faster completion of the game.

# Major Hurdels
Over the course of creating this game I came across many hurdles. 
- Creating cards that presented themselves in a grid. 
- Being able to have the cards appear as if they are flipping to reveal the images under. 
- Creating the JSS, to complete all of the necessary functions such as functionality of the cards, timer, and flip count. 
- Creating an option for the user to be able to have another turn at the game.
